# Bluetooth Peer-to-Peer Messaging (RFCOMM)

# Overview

This project implements a lightweight peer-to-peer Bluetooth messaging application using the RFCOMM protocol. It enables short-range communication between devices without requiring internet connectivity.

The system was developed using C# and WPF, providing real-time device discovery, connection handling, and asynchronous message exchange through Bluetooth serial communication.

##How to Run

1. Install .NET 8 SDK
2. Clone repository

```
git clone <repo-url>
```

3. Open `.sln` or `.csproj` in Visual Studio
4. Restore NuGet packages
5. Run application on two Bluetooth-enabled devices
6. Scan → Connect → Chat
